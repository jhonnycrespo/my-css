Spacing Properties
==================

There are two different ways you can define white space:

    - in absolute terms: using an exact number of pixels,
    - and in relative terms: using percentages or ems.

For now, we'll use pixels because that is easier to learn. However, ultimately you will want to use percentages and ems so your content adapts to different screens.




"Padding" is the white space that sits closest to an HTML element. Many elements already have a default padding defined. For example, ul elements by default are indented to the left a bit because they have a left padding.

The "border" is the area outside the padding of an HTML element. By default, borders are set to be empty, but you can set their width, color, pattern, even an image! Like padding, you can even adjust the four sides of a border independent of one another using border-top, border-right, border-bottom or border-left. You can also adjust the different aspects of a border with border-width, border-color, and border-style.




An HTML element's "margin" is the white space that sits outside the border. Margins of HTML elements interact with other another on the page to determine how they are arranged on the page. A lot of elements have default margins applied.

For example, the body tag typically has a margin that causes any content to not extend all the way to the extreme edge of the page. Be careful, margins can be tricky. When two margins touch they "collapse" such that the space between the elements is equivalent to the larger of the two margins. Like the above properties, you can also set the margins on each side independently using margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-right.
