Font-size sets the overall scale of your text. You can use a lot of different units to set the font size. Some of these units you are probably familiar with if you have used text editors before such as pt size or you can use px size. However, these methods are not advised because they are static and will not adapt based on screen size. 

The ideal way to set text size is to use "em". Em is a way to set your text size based on the system settings of the device in which you are viewing that font. This becomes especially important for users who have special font preferences due to accessibility requirements. To use em do not set font-size on the body tag, but instead set the size for each element in relation to the user's default. For example, 1em is the default, 2em is twice as big, 0.5em is half as big etc.
