Block Element
==============

You can center a block-level element by giving it margin-left and margin-right of auto (and it has a set width, otherwise it would be full width and wouldn't need centering). That's often done with shorthand like this:

margin: 0 auto;

This will work no matter what the width of the block level element you're centering, or the parent.
