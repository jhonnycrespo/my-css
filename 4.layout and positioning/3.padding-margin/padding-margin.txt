Positioning with padding and margin
===================================

Whenever possible, it is ideal to position your elements by adjusting their padding and margins. Sometimes this isn't enough to get the element exactly where you'd like it to be, so we'll learn more tools later in this module. Regardless, you'll almost always want some padding and margin around your element so it's best to adjust these before progressing onto more complicated positioning methods.

Once you have set the width for your element, then you can set margins as a way to position your element relative to others. One of the most commonly used margin settings is "auto". That is because if you set an element's left and right margin to auto it will be dynamically centered within its containing block.

div {
   width: 50%;
   margin-left: auto;
   margin-right: auto;
}

However, note that this only works for block HTML elements like paragraphs, divs and headers. If you want to use this to position an inline element, such as img or a, you will need to tell CSS to treat them as block elements by setting display: block;

img {
   display: block;
   width: 200px;
   margin-left: auto;
   margin-right: auto;
}
