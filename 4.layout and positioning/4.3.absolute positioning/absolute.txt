Position
=========

The "position" property can help you manipulate the location of an element.


Absolute
=========

This tells the browser that whatever is going to be positioned should be removed from the normal flow of the document and will be placed in an exact location on the page. It won't affect how the elements before it or after it in the HTML are positioned on the Web page however it will be subject to it's parents' positioning unless you override it.

If you want to position an element 10 pixels from the top of the document window, you would use the top offset to position it there with absolute positioning:

position: absolute;
top: 10px;

This element will then always display 10px from the top of the page regardless of what content passes through, under or over the element (visually).



Another thing to note is that if you want a absolute element to be confined to a parent element then you need to set the parent element's position to relative. That will keep the child element contained within the parent element and it won't be "relative" to the entire window.
