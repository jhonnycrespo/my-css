One of the simplest ways to align content is to use the direct text-align property. This can help you set the alignment of text or inline content within the context of their containing HTML element.

Note that this property can only apply to block elements like paragraphs, divs and headers.





line-height
============

You may have noticed that the text-align property sets the content's alignment horizontally, but it leaves its vertical alignment unchanged. Text lives within a specified vertical space, in which the text is drawn by default in the middle of that vertical space. If you change the height of the containing HTML block, the text will remain at the top of the block. However, if you instead use the "line-height" property, then the block will grow and the text will vertically center within it.

International Considerations
=============================

Please do not use text-align indiscriminately. If there's a possibility that your site will need to be translated into a language that uses the Arabic, Hebrew, or Thaana scripts (which read from right to left), it creates difficulties to have to change all the  right values to left and vice versa.
